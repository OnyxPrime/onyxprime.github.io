I just finished speaking at NWA TechFest over DevOps. I realized after my session, this is a huge topic and deserved a post.

TL;DR
DevOps is an essential process in developing a great product, fast and efficiently.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is described as the marrying between development and operations to deliver qualtiy products, faster. There are several practices essential to implementing a successful DevOps strategy.

* Agile
..* Continuous Planning
..* Continuous Development
..* Continuous Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Monitoring/Feedback

Last week, I was watching a talk by Bo-ying Fu, Program Manager at Microsoft, [Application Insights for developers: Integrating with your DevOpsÂ workflows](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/T6008), and I think she described DevOps best as the **"Continuous Everything Lifecycle"**. Unlike other strategies, the practices listed above are all being done concurrently. While product managers, program/product owners analysts and leads are planning the next round of work, developers are working on new, or prepping for new features, testers are creating tests for, or testing completed development features, and support teams are providing feedback to owners and program/product managers. These are key to getting those features and fixes which are most important to your customers, or users, out quickly.

### What do I get out of DevOps?
