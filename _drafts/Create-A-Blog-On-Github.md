In my previous post, [Why Am I Doing This]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-19-Why-Am-I-Doing-This %}), I wrote about why I was creating a blog. In this post, I'm going to go over the blogging platform I chose, why and how I set it up.

### Blogging Platforms

There are a variety of blogging platforms available and each have there own benefits. I've listed a few below.

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
* [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
* [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/)
* [Joomla](https://www.joomla.com/)
* [Drupal](http://drupal.com/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [DasBlog](https://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/dasblog.aspx)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [BlogEngine.Net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/)

Some platforms are turn key, software as a service (SaaS), for those non-technical people who just want to get their ideas out there. Other platforms require a host system be provided to run. Some platforms are free, while others have a monthly fee.

As a technical person, I chose to go with Github Pages which has native Jekyll support
