I'm a software developer with 10 years of professional experience with Microsoft technologies. I have learned a breadth of development technologies for desktop (WinForms, WPF, UWA, and UWP), web (WebForms, MVC, AngularJs, and Angular), and mobile (Windows CE, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7/8/8.1, and Xamarin). I'm a proponent of cloud-based solutions, as well as, environments promoting agility, collaboration, innovation and failure as an option.</p>    \n                </div>                           \n                \n                <div className=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12\">\n                    <p>Since I first made the turtle dance around the screen using Logo, I have had a passion for development and am fortunate I get to do what I love for a living.
