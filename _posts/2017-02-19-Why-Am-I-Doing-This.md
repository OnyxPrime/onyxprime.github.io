title: Why Am I Doing This!

For years now, I've been wanting to build a website and start a blog. I've come up with numerous excuses as to why I haven't:

- *I don't have time.*
- *I don't even know how to write a blog.*
- *What would I write about?*
- *Who would want to read what I wrote!?*

But I never found a reason to write a blog, or even create my own website for that matter, until now.  

I'm a software developer, website developer and mobile app developer and I began speaking at tech conferences lat year and absolutely loved it ([Tulsa Tech Fest](http://tulsatechfest.com))! So, I decided in 2017 I was going to focus on presenting at more tech conferences. I was submitting a talk to a great conference up in Wisconsin, [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com), and they require all presenters to provide a website. I didn't have one. So, now I had a reason and a need for a website and why not throw in a blog as well.

Now that I had a reason for a website/blog, there were numerous other questions I had to get answers to:

- What blogging platform should I use?
- Should I host my own, or use SaaS solution?
- If I host my own, 
..* where would I host it?
..* what development technology would I use?
..* do I want to have to support the underlying infrastructure?

Ultimately, I decided to use a hybrid option. I was going to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host my site, but I would develop the website. After researching [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) a little more, I found they recommended Jekyll, and open-source tool for transforming "plain text into static websites and blogs." I am always up for learning about a new tool or technology, so I was excited to get started. [GitHub](https://github.com) made is so esy to get up and running, I had my base site up and running in about an hour. For writing the blog, I would need to use the Markdown syntax, which is something, again, I'd heard of, but never used. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my first post, and I hope you check back to read some of my other upcoming posts
